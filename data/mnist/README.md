The MNIST dataset is made available here to avoid making unnecessary queries to original source. It has a training and test sets of 60k and 10k examples respectively. Features and labels of training and test sets are stored under two numpy files: train.npy, test.npy. For example, train.npy contains x_train, y_train arrays for features and labels respectively.
